                            Hello! I'm William Zhang, a Computer Science major in the Turing Scholars and Dean's Scholars program at the University of Texas at Austin. In the future, I hope to earn a second major in Biochemistry or Biology. I was born in Irvine, California, but lived in Riverside, California for most of my childhood. I moved to Clear Lake, Texas, when I was around 12 and am now in Austin (go figure). 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I am passionate about working in academia in the future. I specifically want to work with utilizing computer science to solve biological problems. As such, I enthusiastically seek opportunities that would teach me skills that would be useful in the future. Over the past summers, I've worked in two different laboratories and interned at one tech company. I hope I will be able to participate in more opportunities in the near future. 
                        </p>

                        <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching anime and playing computer games. In fact, it was Minecraft which introduced me into programming. Feel free to ask me if you want to join me in any of these activites.

                            I played the violin for most of my life. I began when I was roughly five and joined a local youth orchestra when I was in middle school. When I moved to Clear Lake, I joined my high school orchestra and we even made it to nationals at New York (that was a great experience)! 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            I am currently taking data structures (CS 314H), discrete math (CS 311H), genetics (BIO 315H), and 2nd semester calculus (M408D-H). My favorite class is definitely data structures due to all the projects we get. Check out my "Projects" tab to see what I have been working on.
