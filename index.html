                    <div>
                        <p>Hello! I'm William Zhang, an incoming Computer Science major at the University of Texas at Austin. In the future, I hope to earn a second major in Computational Biology at UT. I was born in Irvine, California, but lived in Riverside, California for most of my childhood. I currently live in Clear Lake, Texas, which is a suburb near Houston. </p>

                        <p>
                            I am passionate about becoming a professor in biomathematics in the future. As such, I enthusiastically seek opportunities that would teach me skills that would be useful in the future. Over the past summers, I've worked in two different laboratories and interned at one tech company. I hope I will be able to participate in more opportunities in the near future. 
                        </p>

                        <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching anime and playing games. In fact, it was Minecraft that introduced me into computer programming. Feel free to ask me if you want to join me in any of these activites. I would be glad to.
                        </p>
